# Commands

_Note: these are all "artisan" commands, and thus must be prefixed with `php artisan` (ex. `php artisan shotshare:clean-images`). These also must be executed inside of your docker container, an easy way to do that is using `docker exec -it shotshare php artisan [command you wish to issue]`._

| Command | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `shotshare:clean-images` | Clears out all images (from storage and application) |
| `shotshare:create-user`  | Creates a new user (useful for `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false`) |
