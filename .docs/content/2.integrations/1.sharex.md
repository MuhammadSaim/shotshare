# Setup ShareX

ShotShare is configured to work with [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) a popular screenshot tool. Included in this repo is an [example configuration](https://github.com/mdshack/shotshare/blob/main/shotshare.sxcu) (`/shotshare.sxcu`). Below are a few instructions on how to get this running on your local install.

1. On your ShotShare profile page (when logged in it will be at `{your installation}/profile`), create a new API key
2. Copy the contents of `/shotshare.sxcu` into a notepad
3. Replace `{Your ShotShare URL}` with your ShotShare installation URL, for example `https://demo.shotshare.mdsh.dev`
4. Replace `{Your API Key}` with the API key you created in step #1
5. Copy the contents of your modified `shotshare.sxcu`
6. In ShareX, click `Destinations -> Custom Uploader Settings -> Import -> From Clipboard`
7. On the main screen of ShareX, click `Destinations -> Image Uploader -> Custom Image Uploader`
8. Take a test snapshot (`ctrl` + `print screen`), ensure you get a link to ShotShare in your clipboard
